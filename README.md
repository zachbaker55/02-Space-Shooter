Exercise for MSCH-C220

9/24/22
-=Bounce Blaster=-
A difficult, high-score based shooter. Navigate through a maze and destroy asteroids and enemies. 
Hitting the walls of the maze will frustratingly bounce your ship around. Your movement needs to be precise in order to succeed.
Aim for the highest score!

New implementations from the exercises:
Custom assets created by myself
Set Godot to an upscaled 16:9, "SNES" ()resolution for clean and visible pixel art. (400x224->1600x896)
Background and objects slowly change colors as time passes.
Camera follows the player throughout the world.
Maze that bounces the player, asteroids, and bullets around

## Implementation
Created using [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/download)
The Hyperspace typeface was developed by [Pixel Sagas](https://www.dafont.com/hyperspace.font) and is freely available for personal use.

All other assets were individually created by myself using Aesprite
